The file `reverxii.tex` is a 983 character long (La)TeX program which
lets you play Reversi against your favorite typesetting engine.
Play by running the following command (or the same with `pdftex`, or
`latex`, or `pdflatex` etc.)

    tex reverxii.tex

in the command line.  This will also produce a record of your
game as `reverxii.dvi`.  On the other hand, typeset the documentation
by running

    pdflatex reverxii.dtx
